## Problem Project MIDTERM

Game master is trying to contact you via an old computer. As you may know (or may not know
– doesn’t matter), the screens of computer in early days can only emit shades of green colour
(because of the screens are coated with phosphor – again doesn’t matter). The image of the
game master is converted to green and has some noises in it. Before you can say anything to the
game master, he wants you to make him back in full colours and he will grant you a reward.
His colours are as follow: -
1. Whites and Blacks remain their colours
2. There are no green pixels in original colours
3. His skin is light brown
4. His hair is purple
5. His beard is grey
6. His shirt is blue
7. Finally, he uses the background colour that you all use the most
In total, there must not be more than 7 colours in the final image (I will check using histogram).
Once you finish the tasks, you can choose one of these following rewards – first come first served.

Create a program to restore the image of the game master as above (NO IMAGE PROCESSINGLIBRARIES ALLOWED).
Submit the program in Java, C++, or Python.
